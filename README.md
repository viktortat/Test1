## Что будем делать с проектом

- **Автоматизировать** - tasks in your development workflow.
- **Развивать** - Integrations are built into all major IDEs and people are using gulp with PHP, .NET, Node.js, Java, and other platforms.
- **Simple** - By providing only a minimal API surface, gulp is easy to learn and simple to use
